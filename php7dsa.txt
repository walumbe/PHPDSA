Abstract Data Types
    Stack - Last In First Out(Push and pop)
    Queue - First In First out(enqueue and dequeue)
        enqueue - adding an element at the end of the Queue
        dequeue - removing an element from the front of the Queue

Data Structures
Linear Data Structures - Stack, Queue, Array, List 
    data is stored in a sequential manner
Non Linear data Structures - data is not stored in a sequential manner 
    examples include graph and tree

data structures - struct, priority queue, linked list, doubly linked list, stack, queue, list
                -array, set, map, tree, graph, heap.


Struct- container of names which can be easily accessed using names
Linked list - collection of nodes
in a singly linked list, we can only go forward
Doubly linked list - can move back and forth
    -stores both the next node and the previous node

set- stores certain values but the values are not in any order.
    -there are no repeated values in the set

sometimes a set can be sorted and we call it an ordered set
A map is a collection of key and value pairs..we can liken it to an associative array
graph - non Linear data struture that contains finite number of vertices, edges, arcs or nodes

Characteristics of Algorithms
    -input -output -precision - unambiquity - independent - finite
